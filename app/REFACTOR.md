## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Extract Types and Interfaces ✅
- Created `types/chat.ts` with `MessageWithMetadata`, `ChatWithContextProps`, and other chat-related interfaces
- Created `types/player.ts` with `PlayerContext` and other player-related interfaces
- Created `types/compensation.ts` with compensation-related interfaces and types
- Created `types/externalSources.ts` with external content interfaces
- Updated imports in `ChatWithContext.tsx` and utility files

### Phase 2: Extract Business Logic into Custom Hooks ✅

- Created `hooks/usePlayerContext.ts` to manage player context state and handlers
- Created `hooks/useCompensation.ts` to manage compensation data and processing
- Created `hooks/useChatMessages.ts` to manage chat message state and handlers
- Created `hooks/useExternalSources.ts` to manage external content fetch and state
- Created `hooks/useChatLayout.ts` to manage UI layout state and handlers
- Fixed TypeScript errors and ensured proper type safety

Issues fixed:
- Updated hook interfaces to match component expectations
- Added explicit type annotations for Discord messages and Reddit comments
- Fixed CompensationPanel props to match the component's actual interface
- Resolved incompatibilities between hook return values and component usages
- Fixed parameter naming when calling usePlayerContext (initialGameLevel vs gameLevel)
- Updated Discord and Reddit property references (user/message instead of username/content)
- Added playerId to the PlayerContext interface
- Fixed import paths for compensation types
- Fixed the import path for getExternalSourcesContent in useExternalSources hook
- Updated the type of externalSourcesContent from ExternalSourcesContent to ExternalSources
- Added null checking for sentiment properties in CompensationPanel

### Phase 3: Refactor UI Components ✅

Completed the extraction of reusable UI components from the main ChatWithContext component:

- Created message components:
  - `MessageItem.tsx` for rendering individual messages
  - `MessageList.tsx` for the message container
  - `LoadingIndicator.tsx` for the typing animation

- Created sidebar components:
  - `PlayerContextSidebar.tsx` for the player context panel
  - `PlayerContextForm.tsx` for the editable fields

- Created external content components:
  - `ExternalContentAccordion.tsx` for the expandable section
  - `DiscordMessages.tsx` for rendering Discord content
  - `RedditComments.tsx` for rendering Reddit content
  - `KnownIssueCard.tsx` for displaying known issues

- Created input components:
  - `ChatInput.tsx` for the main message input
  - `ChatControls.tsx` for action buttons

Each component:
- Accepts clear props with TypeScript interfaces
- Handles its own styling
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Is reusable where possible

### Phase 4: Implement Component Integration ✅

- Refactored the main `ChatWithContext.tsx` component to use all the new components
- Integrated components with proper props and handlers
- Improved structure with cleaner parent-child relationships
- Ensured consistent styling and behavior across components
- Fixed minor bugs and edge cases during integration

Next steps:
1. Test all functionality to ensure everything works as expected
2. Implement state management improvements if needed
3. Move to Phase 5: Code Cleanup and Documentation

### Phase 5: Code Cleanup and Documentation ⏳

- Fixed TypeScript errors:
  - Corrected FormEvent typing in handleSendMessage function
  - Updated ExternalContentAccordion props interface to match the actual data structure by creating a TransformedKnownIssueContent interface
  - Fixed form ref usage by properly wrapping ChatInput in a form element
  - Modified ChatInput component to work within a parent form
  - Updated sentiment property access in CompensationPanel to match the SentimentAnalysisResult interface
- (Pending) Remove unused code
- (Pending) Add comprehensive comments
- (Pending) Update README with new architecture details
- (Pending) Perform final code review
- (Pending) Create tests for critical components and hooks
